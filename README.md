# BundledViews
This library contains a bunch of different libraries that have been rewritten because they were inefficient or hard to use.

## Featuring
[SmartTabLayout library](https://github.com/ogaclejapan/SmartTabLayout)

## Installation
Add this to your build.gradle:
```
allprojects {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```

Add the dependency:
```
implementation 'com.github.ProDev2:BundledViews:1.8'
```

Alternatively add the last version without AndroidX instead:
```
implementation 'com.github.ProDev2:BundledViews:1.7'
```
